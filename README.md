# grt-live-bus-info
I'm working on a website for it, ughkay? This is just a script though. Run it on a cronjob. You can probably change it for your transit operator, but sometimes transit operators don't fill out certain fields I wanted or they don't provide a GTFS feed, so I didn't want to make this seem like a general, all-purpose product. It works with GRT.
